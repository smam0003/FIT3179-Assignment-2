          The Paralympic Games is a quadrennial event that allows para-athletes
          with ranging disabilities and impairment levels to compete in many
          different international sports. Usually held shortly after and in the
          same city as the Olympics, the Paralympics aims to provide the same
          worldwide exposure for para-athletes as those who are able-bodied.
          This visualisation aims to provide various analyses on the Games in
          terms of finding out the most para-athlete producing countries, most
          successful continent, athletesâ€™ successes, and team balance.

          The worldwide spread of Paralympics has increased tremendously since
          its inception, with over X participating countries in the 2020 Tokyo
          Paralympics compared to only Y countries in the 1960 Rome Olympics.
          More and more countries from Africa, Asia, and South America have
          participated in the Games. Australia has had consistently high
          athletes per 10 million population, ranging from about X to Y. The
          most consistent Paralympian-producing country is Iceland holding over
          a record 560.68 athletes per 10 million population in 1988. There is a
          trend of countries producing more para-athletes the more away the
          countries are located from the Equator due to the higher advocacy for
          the Paralympic Games amongst those places to encourage more athletes
          to participate.

          According to the chart, there is indeed a positive medium correlation
          between the number of participating athletes and medals won in all
          types which suggest that the higher the number of athletes, the more
          medals the country is going to win. One notable feature is that there
          are some countries with a very high medal to athlete ratio, (i.e
          China, 2020 (0.81) suggesting 81% of the athletes come home with a
          medal). This suggests that the closer to the top-right of the plot the
          country is, the higher the medal-to-athlete ratio. Thus countries that
          aim to have more success should focus on increasing their athlete's
          attendance.

          For many years, North American countries have dominated the Games,
          ranking first 8 times from 1960-1988 in total medals, but went on a
          decline since then. The top rank is replaced by Oceanian countries,
          partly because of their rise in medals won and a small number of
          countries. The most consistent continent is Asia, ranking fourth
          consistently throughout. Another notable finding is the massive drop
          in ranking for Europe in '64 and '68 due to some of its countries
          having poor performance. There are similar changes in rankings for
          gold and silver medals, while there are significant fluctuations for
          second between Europe and NA, and fifth between Africa and SA.

          Unfortunately, the Paralympics Games had been the majority
          male-dominant event. However, in the 2020 Games, North American
          countries combined has achieved the lowest % difference between men
          and women at 1%, with 246 men and 243 women athletes. It is only a
          matter of time in the future where we will see more representation of
          women para-athletes in the event, balancing both men and women
          athletes. The overall trend worldwide looks to decline in the %
          difference between male and female athletes, suggesting more exposure
          to female athletes to participate.
