          The <span id="imp_text">Paralympic Games</span> is a quadrennial event
          that allows para-athletes with ranging disabilities and impairment
          levels to compete in many different international sports. Usually held
          shortly after and in the same city as the Olympics, the Paralympics
          aims to provide the same <span id="imp_text">worldwide</span> exposure
          for para-athletes as those who are able-bodied. This visualisation
          aims to provide various analyses on the Games in terms of finding out
          the most para-athlete producing countries, most successful continent,
          athletesâ€™ successes, and team balance.

          The worldwide spread of Paralympics has increased tremendously since
          its inception, with over <span id="imp_text">162</span> participating
          countries in the 2020 Tokyo Paralympics compared to only
          <span id="imp_text">17</span> countries in the 1960 Rome Games. More
          and more countries from
          <span id="imp_text">Africa, Asia, and South America</span> have
          participated in the Games, where there were barely any in the
          beginning. Looking into <span id="imp_text">Australia</span>, it has
          had consistent number of athletes per 10 million population, ranging
          from about <span id="imp_text">10.7 to 149.32</span>. The highest
          consistent Paralympian-producing country is
          <span id="imp_text">Iceland</span> holding over a record
          <span id="imp_text">560.68</span>
          athletes per 10 million population in 1988. There is a trend of
          countries producing more para-athletes the more away the countries are
          located from the Equator due to the higher advocacy for the Paralympic
          Games amongst those places to encourage more athletes to participate.

          According to the chart, there is indeed a
          <span id="imp_text">positive</span> medium correlation between the
          number of participating athletes and medals won in all types which
          suggest that the higher the number of athletes, the more medals the
          country is going to win. One notable feature is that there are some
          countries with a very high medal to athlete ratio, (i.e China, 2020
          (0.81) suggesting <span id="imp_text">81%</span> of the athletes come
          home with a medal). This suggests that the closer to the top-right of
          the plot the country is, the <span id="imp_text">higher</span> the
          medal-to-athlete ratio. Thus countries that aim to have more success
          should focus on increasing their athlete's attendance.

          For many years, <span id="imp_text">North American</span> countries
          have dominated the Games, ranking first
          <span id="imp_text">8</span> times from 1960-1988 in total medals, but
          went on a decline since then. The top rank is replaced by
          <span id="imp_text">Oceanian</span> countries, partly because of their
          rise in medals won while having a small number of countries. The most
          consistent continent is <span id="imp_text">Asia</span>, ranking
          fourth consistently throughout. Another notable finding is the massive
          drop in ranking for <span id="imp_text">Europe</span> in '64 and '68
          due to some of its countries having poor performance. There are
          similar changes in rankings for gold and silver medals, but
          significant fluctuations in brown medals for second between Europe and
          NA, and fifth between Africa and SA due to the extra competition in
          the last place on the podium.

          Unfortunately, the Paralympics Games had been the majority
          male-dominant event. However, in the 2020 Games,
          <span id="imp_text">North American</span> countries combined has
          achieved the lowest % difference between men and women at about
          <span id="imp_text">1%</span>, with 246 men and 243 women athletes. It
          is only a matter of time in the future where we will see more
          <span id="imp_text">representation</span> of women para-athletes in
          the event, balancing both men and women athletes. The overall trend
          worldwide looks to <span id="imp_text">decline</span> in the %
          difference between male and female athletes as well, suggesting more
          <span id="imp_text">exposure</span> to female athletes to participate.
